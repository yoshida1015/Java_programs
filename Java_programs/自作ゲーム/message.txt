The keyword that expresses the basic philosophy of Keio University's Faculty of
Science and Technology is "emergence". What this means is the holistic manifestation
of dramatic breakthroughs that, from the standpoint of the individual constituent
elements' nature and inter-relational functions, are unpredictable and unexplainable.

The task of the 21st century is to find solutions to the various problems - biological,
global environmental, informational, social systematic, and anthropological -
that for 20th century science technology were so perplexing. We believe that
the key to success lies in grasping the concept of emergence.
